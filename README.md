CountUp Timer in Unity
Overview
This Unity project demonstrates a count-up timer implemented using C# scripting and the TextMeshPro UI system. The timer dynamically updates the displayed value based on a customizable speed, making it ideal for displaying elapsed time or incremental counters in games and applications.

Features
Dynamic Timer Display:
Continuously counts up and updates the text display in real time.
Customizable Speed:
Easily adjust the speed at which the timer increments using a serialized field.
TextMeshPro Integration:
Utilizes the TextMeshPro component for high-quality UI text rendering.
How It Works
Timer Logic:
The timer increments over time using Time.deltaTime multiplied by the customizable Speed value.
Text Update:
The timer value is converted to a string and displayed in a TextMeshProUGUI component using SetText().
Code Highlights
Serialized Fields:
The script uses [SerializeField] to allow easy assignment of the TextMeshPro component and timer speed in the Unity Inspector.
Frame-Based Updates:
The Update() method ensures the timer increments each frame, creating a smooth and accurate display.
Setup Instructions
Attach Script:
Add the CountUp script to a GameObject in your Unity scene.
Assign Text Component:
Drag and drop a TextMeshProUGUI component from your UI hierarchy into the Text field of the script in the Unity Inspector.
Adjust Speed:
Set the desired speed for the timer in the Speed field. A value of 1 means the timer increments in real-time.
Run the Scene:
Play the scene to see the timer counting up in the UI.
